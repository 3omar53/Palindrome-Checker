# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks if a given input is a palindrome. The project consists of an HTML file for the structure, a JavaScript file for functionality, and a CSS file for styling.

## Features

- Enter text in the input field.
- Click the "Check" button to determine if the input is a palindrome.
- Receive feedback in the result section indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3omar53/palindrome-checker.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter text in the input field and click the "Check" button to see the result.

## How it Works

The JavaScript code uses a simple palindrome-checking algorithm, considering alphanumeric characters only. The application provides feedback in the result section based on whether the input is a palindrome or not.
